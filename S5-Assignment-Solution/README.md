- Write a single model.py file that includes GN/LN/BN and takes an argument to decide which normalization to include
- Write a single notebook file to run all the 3 models above for 20 epochs each
- Create these graphs:
  - Graph 1: Test/Validation Loss for all 3 models together
  - Graph 2: Test/Validation Accuracy for 3 models together
  - graphs must have proper annotation
- Find 10 misclassified images for each of the 3 models, and show them as a 5x2 image matrix in 3 separately annotated images.
