Experiment 1
------------------------------------
**Objective / Target**

* Initial Setup and Model
* Getting the model correct
* Very basic model

**Results**

* Parameters: 6,379,786
* Best Train Accuracy: 99.91 %
* Best Test Accuracy: 99.28 %

**Analysis**

* Large but working model
* Overfitting (train - test accuracy) > 0

**Next Steps**

* Reduce Number of Params
* Remove overfitting
