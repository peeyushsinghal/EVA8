Experiment 1
------------------------------------
**Objective / Target**

* Initial Setup and Model
* Getting the model correct
* Very basic model

**Results**

* Parameters: 6,379,786
* Best Train Accuracy: 99.91 %
* Best Test Accuracy: 99.28 %

**Analysis**

* Large but working model
* Overfitting (train - test accuracy) > 0

**Next Steps**

* Reduce Number of Params
* Remove overfitting


Experiment 2
--------------
**Objective / Target**
*   Reduce Params 
*   Reduce overfitting


**Results**

* Parameters: 4,038
* Best Train Accuracy: 97.73 %
* Best Test Accuracy: 98.23 %

**Analysis**

* Small model
* Not able to hit the accuracy mark
* Overfitting (train - test accuracy) < 0 contained

**Next Steps**

* Increase Number of Params
* little overfitting, not much
